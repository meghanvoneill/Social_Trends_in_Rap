# Social_Trends_in_Rap

This project seeks sentiment extraction on music lyrics, with particular focus on Rap and R&B music, over time.

## Data Set

The data set was built using data points from multiple sources, including Billboard.com, Genius Lyrics, and Apple Music.

The Billboard.com data was obtained through web scraping using BeautifulSoup.
The Genius Lyrics and Apple Music data was obtained through API calls.

The data is hosted on GCP using Docker containerization.

## Further Work

Once the data set is built and covers a large enough set of data points, supervised and unsupervised learning methods 
can be applied to further explore trends in this music genre. There is also opportunity for expansion into other genres
and comparison analysis of sentiment across genres.
